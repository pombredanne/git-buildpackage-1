This is a bunch of scripts to ease the development of Debian packages with git.
For more documentation see the manual. On Debian systems this can be found in
/usr/share/doc/git-buildpackage/manual-html.

It can be found online at

    http://honk.sigxcpu.org/projects/git-buildpackage/manual-html/gbp.html


The limited documentation available for the RPM support can be found at

    http://marquiz.github.com/git-buildpackage-rpm/

Unfortunately, the manpages for RPM tools are still missing. Refer to
--help option of the commands, for the most detailed description of different
options.
