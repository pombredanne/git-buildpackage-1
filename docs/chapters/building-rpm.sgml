    <title>Building RPM packages from the &git; repository</title>
    <para>
    The &git-buildpackage-rpm; tool is used for building.
    The tool creates the source tarball and copies it and the packaging files
    to a separate build directory and builds the package there. By default, 
    &rpmbuild; is used as the builder command. You can define a different builder
    command with the <option>--git-builder</option> option.
